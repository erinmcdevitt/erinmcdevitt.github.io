I'm a data enthusiast, passionate about climate and financing the transition towards a net zero future. I previously have worked as an analyst at a global asset manager, focusing on global financial markets and the intersection of impact/sustainability and investment strategies. Prior to this, I spent 7 years in the quasi-government sphere as a financial analyst focused on foreign financial systems and identifying emerging risks, such as those posed by climate change.
